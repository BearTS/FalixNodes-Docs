Then u can go to [GamePanel](https://gp.falixnodes.net) and install Minecraft on the server by following the steps below

#### Steps To Install Minecraft Server From The Game Panel
- Go to the [GamePanel](https://gp.falixnodes.net) and login with your ID and Password (which you get at the client panel)
- Then select the server which you made and click on start then it'll prompt you with a lot of options.
- First, enter `1` to select `Minecraft Java`, then select a software of your choice, for the sake of this tutorial, I'll be choosing PaperSpigot 1.16.3
- So first I'll enter 1 into the console to select Minecraft Java, then I'll select 1 for PaperSpigot, then I'll enter 1.16.3, and I'll wait, after a while the server reboots and now you can play on it with the IP given above in the console.
